# Overview
The code in the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Q60module/PersonalMode/main/code/car_mode.ino">ca_mode.ino</a> has the Arduino CPU do the following:
1. Sleep (do nothing) for 20 seconds to give the car time to get settled (this might not be needed).
2. Close the normally-open relay for 200 milliseconds and then open it again
3. Sleep (do nothing) for 700 milliseconds
4. Perform steps 2 and 3 twice more
